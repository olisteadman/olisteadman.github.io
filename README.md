Based on [Cool Layout with Complex Chainable Animation](https://codepen.io/suez/pen/rLGvxr) which was inspired by [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/2802024-Satellite-Website-Prototype).

Based on addition of just 2 classes with JS (and simple hover) this demo features a lot of cool chaining animations, combined with good performance and sort-of easy-to-maintain scss.
